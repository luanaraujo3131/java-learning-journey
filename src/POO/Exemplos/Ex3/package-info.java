/**
 * In this module, I will resolve a problem without oop, then using oop, there is the problem:
 *
 * Write a progam to read measurement of the side of two triangles X and Y.
 * Then, show the value of both sides and tell which of the two have the largest area
 * area = square root of p *(p - a)*(p - b)*(p-c)
 * where p = a + b + c / 2
 * square root = MATH.sqrt(param)
