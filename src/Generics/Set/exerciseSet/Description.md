On a online course website, every user has a unique ID.

Each teacher can have several courses, and each student  can enroll in as many courses as they want. So, the total number of students of a teacher is not just the sum of students of every course that they have, as there may be repeat students in the same course.

A teacher have the course A, B and C, and he wants to know how many students there are in these courses.

Write a program to read the students of A,B and C. Then show the total of them.
